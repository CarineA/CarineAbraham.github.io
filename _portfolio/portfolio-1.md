Back in 2020 a few friends and I decided to start a podcast! As Language researchers, and bilinguals, we wanted to talk about something near and dear to our hearts and talk with others about their experiences. For the podcast, I hosted episodes, helped doing research on our guests, coordinated recording sessions, managed out website, and edited our audio before release. 

Much Language Such Talk (MLST), is a podcast that discusses topics on bi- and multilingualism and what it means to speak more than one language. It explored the benefits, the advantages, the struggles of bilingualism, what it entails, and what it means in the daily life of people who speak, know, and study more than one language.

The podcast addressed topics such as language change, how we learn languages at different ages, bilingualism and language disorders, language identity and culture, minority languages, language policies, language education â€“ you name it!
