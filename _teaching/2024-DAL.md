### Course summary
This course is an introduction to data analysis with linguistic data, using the statistical software R.

### Course objectives
The course is a gentle introduction to data analysis for linguistics using the R software.

Students will learn how manage linguistic data through hands-on tutorials and how to conduct exploratory data analysis according to practices that are relevant to the field of linguistics. The course will teach the use of the programming software R: students will be able to import common data formats, tidy and transform data, choose and report appropriate summary measures, create compelling graphs, and identify and avoid common interpretation pitfalls.

By the end of the course, students will have gained a sufficient background to independently conduct exploratory data analyses with linguistic data, for example as required for their final dissertation. At the same time, the course will provide students with opportunities to develop transferable computer skills.

While the focus of the course is on the analysis of quantitative data, students interested in qualitative data analysis will also benefit from attending the course by learning how to manage data and create graphs in R.
