Follow on introductory linguistics course (from LEL 1A) for undergraduate students.

### Course summary
This course follows on from LEL1A, developing the tools and knowledge needed to investigate in a systematic way the different subsystems of language dealing with sound, meaning, word and sentence structure already introduced in that course, and how these subsystems are subject to variation and change.

### Course objective
Building on the understanding of how language works developed in LEL1A, LEL1B focuses on acquiring the skills and knowledge to investigate further some central aspects of language. The course discusses the structure of human language, the ways in which languages can vary and change, and the ways in which language is put to use. Topics include the study of meaning and the influence of context on meaning, word and sentence structure, sounds and sound systems, language variation and change, and how the history of languages can be investigated.
