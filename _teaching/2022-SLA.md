### Course summary
The aim of this course is to give an introduction to current research on second language acquisition (SLA) by reviewing key issues, concepts, findings and theories and provide the opportunity to critically evaluate models and theories of SLA by applying them to the analysis of second language data.

### Course Objectives
This course introduces students to the principal findings, models, and research methods in the field of second language acquisition. The course surveys general issues such as the role of the native language, the effects on the second language on the first, universals, age, input and interaction and processing, as well as characteristics of the acquisition of phonology, lexicon, and syntax in second language learners. The empirical component of the course provides students with experience in designing and carrying out studies in second language acquisition. 

On completion of this course, the student will be able to:
- Understand the basic issues in second language acquisition (SLA) including: individual differences in SLA; age effects on SLA; the role of the native language in SLA; the initial state and end state of second language grammar; native language attrition and child second language learning.
- Analyse learner data using the concepts and models taught in the course
