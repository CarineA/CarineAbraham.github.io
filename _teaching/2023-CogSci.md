### Course objectives
This course introduces students to the study of Cognitive Science as the intersection of an array of interrelated disciplines including philosophy, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, computer science, human-computer interaction, and neuroscience.

Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary effort to uncover the relationships between brains, minds, computation, and behaviour. The course combines a high-level perspective on key questions that the field of Cognitive Science aims to address along with a nuts-and-bolts training in computational skills that will serve as a necessary foundation for future courses in PPLS and Informatics.

Classes and assignments will cover topics in areas such as language, learning, perception, action, and thought. Students will receive hands-on training in the transferable skills of computer programming.
